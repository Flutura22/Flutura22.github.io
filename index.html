        <p>
         Dear Cikush, during times of sadness, know that you're not alone.  
         Your strength in vulnerability is a testament to your resilience and courage. 
         I understand that life's challenges can sometimes weigh heavily on your heart, 
         casting shadows where there should be light, making you feel lost, when the road is one step way.
         But please remember, even in the darkest of moments, you taught me that there's a flicker of hope waiting to be reignited. 
         Whether it's finding solace in the lyrics of The Smiths, 
         escaping into the pages of a beloved book, or simply sharing your thoughts, 
         know that I'm here to offer comfort and support. 
         Your sadness doesn't define you; it's merely a part of you and proof of your strength. 
         Together, we'll navigate through these rough waters, holding onto each other until the 
         storm passes, as we have done a million times, as we will do a million more.

          Dear Cikush, if ever you find yourself feeling lonely, remember that my friendship

          Though we may be physically apart, know that my love and support are with you, 
          unwavering and unconditional. Loneliness can sometimes creep in even amidst the bustling chaos of life, 
          but know that you're never truly alone. Reach out, and I'll be there to listen, to console, 
          and to remind you of the incredible person you are. I love our moments of connection, 
          whether it's through shared memories, late-night conversations, or simply knowing that 
          someone out there cares deeply for you. You are cherished, you are loved, and you are never alone.
